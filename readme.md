# Tightly Coupled GNSS Data Logger

The main repo for the Tightly Coupled GNSS Data Logger created for Embedded Systems Design Project (IL2232) at KTH during the fall semester of 2022.

## What it is

This system is meant to be used as an easily deployable and off-grid research tool with an extremely small uptime.
It posseses various sensors onboard which it can trigger to record continuously using ROS as it's data backend in a tightly integrated fashion.
It is highly configurable and fully controlled via a central terminal application.

## Getting Started

We recommend having a look at the documentation [here](https://tightly-coupled-gnss-logger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get a general idea of the structure of the system.

## Final System

Below is a picture of the final system we implemented and tested in the lab and in real life scenarios.

## A quick peek

Here is an example of simple GNSS data that was acquired with the system during a car test:
